# object-detect-mobile-app

Project Title: Cross-Platform Mobile Object Detection App

Project Description:

Create a skeletal structure for a cross-platform mobile application designed for real-time object detection. This initial phase will focus on setting up the essential components and framework without incorporating advanced features. The core requirements include:

Mobile Framework: Use React Native for cross-platform development (iOS and Android).
Machine Learning Framework: Integrate TensorFlow Lite for on-device object detection.
Camera Integration: Enable access to the device's camera and display a live video feed in the app.
Basic Object Detection: Implement rudimentary object detection capabilities using a placeholder or sample model (not YOLOv5 or EfficientDet yet).
Bounding Box Display: Draw bounding boxes around detected objects on the camera feed.
User Interface: Design a minimal UI with a camera view and basic controls (e.g., start/stop detection).
